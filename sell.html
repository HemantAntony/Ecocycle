        <h3>Don't know what to do with used plastics?</h3>
        <h4>Do you have used plastics lying in your backyards waiting to be burned. Well... you shouldn't</h4>
        <h4>Burning plastic is extremely damaging to the environment. Burning plastic can release toxic fumes which not only can cause cancer, but can return to the Earth in the form of acid during rain</h4>
        <h4>Here's where we come in. Its simple. You give the plastic to us and we give you money in return</h4>
